### Architecture
[TBD]
Please find the English translation below.

Architecture

・By using Google Auth for login, we automatically provide users with an Account Abstraction Wallet, making it easy to obtain a wallet. Users can acquire NFTs and FTs with a single click, even if they don't have a wallet.

・During this process, users don't have to pay gas fees due to gasless transactions, and since the tokens have gone through a community audit, there is less concern about receiving scam tokens.

・Companies that want to expand their community can propose detailed information about airdrop in a proposal, which will help them learn whether a token airdrop is feasible or not.
